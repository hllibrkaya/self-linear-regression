# Project Name

The aim of this project is to create a linear regression algorithm from scratch and test the model on a sample dataset

# Model Details

* Weight Initialization: The weights are initialized using random values between 0 and 1.
* Prediction Function: Predictions are made using the dot product of input features and weights, plus the bias term.
* Cost Function: The cost function is mean squared error (MSE) with optional L1 and L2 regularization terms.
* Weights Update: Gradient descent is used to update weights and bias to minimize the cost function.
* Regularization: L1 and L2 regularization terms are applied to prevent overfitting.
* Training Process: The model is trained using the specified learning rate, number of iterations, and regularization parameters.
* Cost vs. Iteration plot: A plot function that illustrates the change in cost per iteration
